This is the first open money implementation I wrote.  It's built on top of YAWAF (yet another web application framework) a perl based framework that I built and used for a number of years.

Development of this app was superseded by two rails based server/client apps at: https://github.com/openmoney 

This code is not in active development, but represents quite a bit of work and has some interesting patterns so I thought I would put up in case it is of use to anybody, and for archival purposes.
